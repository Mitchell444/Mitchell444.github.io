        <p>Hi, I am Mitchell Gerwin and I am a graduate of Sylvania Northview
             Highschool. I went through the computer science career tech and 
             have played soccer my whole life. In my free time I like to mess
             around with computer between building them myself and playing
             videogames on my own builds. I am currently going to Ohio
             Northern University to continue on and get a degree in 
             computer science.
        </p>
