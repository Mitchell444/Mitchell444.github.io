        <h2>Multipage Website</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/Mitchell444/Multipage-Website">Github Link</a>
        <p>I created this website by myself and the goal was to make an
            interactive website with multiple pages about something of
            my choice. I choose soccer as my topic and I tried to make an
            informative and visually appealing website for someone to go to.

        <h2>HTML Web Page</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/Mitchell444/HTML-Web-Page-Project">Github Link</a>
        <p>This was one of my first html pages I created and focused a lot of efforts
            on the styling of the page. It used a lot of different formatting options
            and the most challenging part faced at the time was the formatting.
        </p>
        <h2>Bootstrap Project</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/Mitchell444/BootstrapProject">Github Link</a>
        <p>This project was meant to showcase the new website formatting options through Bootstrap
            We were able to creating many new things such as buttons, background images and navbars.
            Something challenging was figuring out the navbar and formatting of
            the website as a whole, but we were able to use template and old navbar 
            code to help overcome this.
